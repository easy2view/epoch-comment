  ，尤其破坏我的参选活动，特此写信向你们陈明情况，并请求你们及具体政府部门立刻关闭纽约中领馆，同时对他们的犯罪行为进行调查，以捍卫美国宪法，还美国人民正常自由的生活，守护美国价值。
 </p>
 <p>
  作为1989年天安门学运领袖，我走出中共监牢，于1992年6月来到美国获得

  。我深知自由的不易，很快就于1994年加入美国陆军成为一名战士。后来，在伟大的参议员Storm

  </ok>
  ，国家需要前线军牧，我相应总统号召，毅然第二次加入美国陆军现役，代表纽约人民奔赴伊拉克前线，捍卫美国宪法并服事美国将士。在陆军服役共27年后，我于去年回到家乡纽约。
 </p>
 <p>
  作为一个荣休的军官和八个孩子的父亲，且有15年大学生涯的博士牧师，我本可以安度晚年潜心写作照顾家庭；可是，纽约的情况实在是太令人伤心了，新冠肆虐，经济糟糕，仇恨犯罪猖獗，族群分裂。我在社区民众的支持下，决定出来参选纽约10选区国会议员。
 </p>
 <p>
  在这个过程中，我与华人社区民众建立了广泛的联系，并得到他们的认同和支持。可是，中领馆因为我曾是天安门学生领袖，又因为我发表过许多有关自由民主人权的文章，包括我2005年的退出中共申明等，中领馆通过各种手段阻扰我的参选。
 </p>
 <p>
  在3月16日司法部公布的文件中，中共甚至派人制造丑闻、车祸，暗杀我等等。
 </p>
 <p>
  就中领馆对我参选的具体干扰和破坏，我有许多证人和证据。例如，我3月16日从探访乌克兰回到纽约，原本我在唐人街的竞选办公室19号开始工作，并有一个确定好了的筹款晚会，但是领事馆在17号和18号通知他们的亲共侨领不能参加我的活动，不能捐款，不能投票，并威胁他们，如果他们不听从，就不让他们回国做生意。
 </p>
 <p>
  19号那一天晚上，原定500多人的大型参会，有大部分没有来。事后，有许多侨领找到我和我们的团队成员，解释说，不是他们不支持，实在是中领馆的压力和威胁。
 </p>
 <p>
  自那以后，中领馆，继续与侨民组织打招呼，要他们不要参加我的活动。 例如， 这个月18号，因为Fox News
 </p>
 <p>
  对我采访报导，原定有400多人参加，中领馆又对决定参加的侨领发出威慑指令，结果，大部分答应要来的都没有来。
 </p>
 <p>
  更有严重的事， 有几个长期亲共分子直接带人进入中领馆，具体策划如何破坏我的参选。这些，都有人证。
 </p>
 <p>
  鉴于上述情况，我特此写信给总统和议长，从私人关系讲我们也是30年的老朋友，从捍卫美国宪法上讲，请你们高度重视中领馆在全美国长期干涉美国选举的事，尤其这一次纽约中领馆破坏和干涉我本人参选的事。
 </p>
 <p>
  我建议你们和相关的政府部门立刻关闭纽约中领馆，并对他们的犯罪行为展开调查。
 </p>
 <p>
  我是个捍卫了美国宪法27年的军人，我将继续捍卫宪法，坚定地要把揭露纽约中领馆干涉美国大选和破坏我参选的活动进行到底！
 </p>
 <p>
  专此
 </p>
 <p>
  敬礼

  Letter from New York Congressional Candidate Yan Xiong to President Biden and Speaker Pelosi
 </p>
 <p>
  –Calling on the U.S. government to immediately close the Chinese Consulate in New York and immediately launch an investigation into the criminal conduct of the Chinese Consulate in interfering in the U.S. election
 </p>
 <p>
  Dear President Biden and Speaker Pelosi,
 </p>
 <p>
  I am Yan Xiong, a current candidate for Congress in New York’s 10th Congressional District. I am writing to you regarding the serious interference of the Chinese Consulate in New York in the U.S. election, especially the disruption of my campaign. I am urging you and specific government agencies to immediately close the Chinese Consulate in New York and investigate their criminal behavior in order to defend the U.S. Constitution, restore the freedom of the American people, and protect American values.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a leader of the 1989 Tiananmen School Movement, I came out of a Chinese Communist prison and was granted political asylum in the United States in June 1992. sKnowing how hard-fought freedom is, I enlisted the U.S. Army as a soldier in 1994. Later, with the help of the great Senator Strom Thurmond, I went back to school for eight years and remained an army reserve officer. As a result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the nation needed frontline soldiers and I responded to the President’s call to join the U.S. Army on active duty for a second time, representing the people of New York on the frontlines in Iraq, defending the U.S. Constitution and serving the American soldiers. After a total of 27 years of service in the Army, I returned home to New York last year.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a retired military officer and father of eight children, and a doctorate with a 15-year college career, I hoped to spend my later years writing and caring for my family. However, the situation in New York has become so distressing, with the new COVID variants, the economic crisis, hate crimes, and racial tensions. With the support of my community, I decided to run for Congress in New York’s 10th Congressional District. In the process, I have established extensive contacts with people in the Chinese community and garnered their approval and support.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the Chinese Consulate blocked my candidacy through various means because I was a former student leader in Tiananmen Square and had published many articles about freedom, democracy and human rights, including my declaration of withdrawal from the Chinese Communist Party in 2005. In the document released by the Ministry of Justice on March 16, the CCP even sent people to create scandals, car accidents, assassinate me, etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have many witnesses and evidence regarding the specific interference and disruption of my candidacy by the Chinese Consulate.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, when I returned to New York from visiting Ukraine on March 16th, I was supposed to start work at my campaign office in Chinatown on the 19th and have a confirmed fundraising party, but the consulate informed their pro-communist expatriate leaders on the 17th and 18th that they could not attend my events, make donations, or vote, and threatened them that if they did not comply, they would not be allowed to return to their home countries to do business.
 </p>
 <p>
  On that night of the 19th, the majority of the expected turnout of over 500 attendees did not show up. Afterwards, many overseas leaders approached me and our team members and explained that it was not because they did not support the event, but because of the pressure and threats from the Chinese Consulate. Since then, the Chinese Consulate, continues to greet with oversea Chinese organizations and pressure them not to attend my events.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, on the 18th of this month, because of my interview on Fox News, more than 400 people were scheduled to attend the event, and the Chinese Consulate issued a deterrence order to the oversea Chinese leaders who decided to attend. In a more serious matter, several long-time pro-communists brought people directly into the Chinese Consulate to plan exactly how to sabotage my candidacy. All of these have been witnessed.
 </p>
 <p>
  In view of the above, I am writing to the President and the Speaker of the House to ask you, as personal friends of 30 years, and in defense of the U.S. Constitution, to seriously examine the long-standing interference of the Chinese Consulate in U.S. elections throughout the United States, and in particular, the disruption and interference of the Chinese Consulate in New York in my own candidacy.
 </p>
 <p>
  I urge that you and the relevant government agencies immediately shut down the Chinese Consulate in New York and launch an investigation into their criminal conduct.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am a soldier who has defended the U.S. Constitution for 27 years, and I will continue to defend it. I am determined to see the New York Chinese Consulate’s interference in the U.S. election and sabotage of my candidacy through to the end!
 </p>
 <p>
  Sincerely yours,
 </p>
 <p>
  Yan Xiong
